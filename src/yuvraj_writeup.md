## Note:

While working on this lab, we ran into some unforeseen circumstances with ADAMS shutting down, which hindered our ability to collect all the data. While we were able to get most of the data before ADAM went down, we were unable to collect data for HDD Sequential Stride Write, HDD Random Read, HDD Random Write, and SSD Sequential Stride Write. Out of these, we were able to gather the data for the SSD by running it locally on our machine. However, since none of us own a PC and we do not have access to a machine with an HDD, we were unable to collecte data for the 3. We also tried collecting data by running the script on Longleaf, but alas, we did not have the proper permissions to read / write data. 

Tl;dr: We were unable to collect the data necessary for HDD Sequential Stride Write, HDD Random Read, HDD Random Write and we request your leniency while grading these 3 plots.

## HDD

HDD performance improves significantly with larger I/O sizes, stabilizing at high throughput for sequential access patterns. Smaller I/O sizes and random access result in lower performance and higher variability, emphasizing the need for optimized I/O batching and sequential operations.

### HDD Sequential Read

- The throughput stabilizes around 180 MB/s for I/O sizes above a certain threshold (e.g., ~4 KB). Smaller I/O sizes have significantly lower throughput and higher variability, indicating inefficiency for small requests.

- For optimal performance, file systems or applications should use larger I/O sizes (e.g., >=4 KB). This minimizes overhead and maximizes hardware utilization, particularly important for HDDs where throughput improves with sequential, larger block reads.

### HDD Sequential Write

- Similar to read throughput, write performance improves as I/O size increases, stabilizing at around 150â€“200 MB/s for I/O sizes above ~16 KB. Smaller I/O sizes again show significant variability.

- Applications or file systems should batch or buffer small writes into larger blocks to achieve higher throughput. This is critical for HDDs, as frequent small writes degrade performance due to increased seek and rotational latency.

### HDD Sequential Stride Read

![HDD_Sequential_Stride_Read](assets/HDD%20Sequential%20Stride%20Read.png)

 - Larger I/O sizes (e.g., 10 MB, 8 MB) have higher throughput (~150-175 MB/s) regardless of the stride size, showing efficient sequential access. Smaller I/O sizes (e.g., 4 KB, 256 KB) experience much lower throughput, especially with smaller strides, highlighting inefficiency in handling frequent small reads.

 - Throughput for smaller I/O sizes improves slightly as stride size increases but remains substantially lower than that of larger I/O sizes. This implies that applications optimizing for HDD read performance should prioritize larger I/O sizes over adjusting stride sizes alone.
